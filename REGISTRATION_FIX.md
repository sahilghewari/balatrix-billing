# 🔧 Registration Form Fixed!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
The frontend registration form was sending different fields than what the backend expected:

**Frontend was sending:**
- `name` (single field)
- `email`
- `company`
- `password`

**Backend expected:**
- `firstName` ✅
- `lastName` ✅
- `email` ✅
- `phoneNumber` ✅ (was missing!)
- `password` ✅ (with strict requirements)

### Solution Applied

1. **Updated Registration Schema**
   - Split `name` into `firstName` and `lastName`
   - Added `phoneNumber` field with E.164 format validation
   - Updated password requirements to match backend (12 chars min)

2. **Updated Form Fields**
   - Added "First Name" and "Last Name" inputs (side by side)
   - Added "Phone Number" input with country code hint
   - Removed "Company Name" field (not in backend schema)
   - Updated password helper text

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Now shows specific validation errors from backend
   - Displays each field error individually
