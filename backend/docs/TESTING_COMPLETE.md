## Best Practices Implemented

1. ✅ **Test Isolation** - Each test is independent with clean database state

3. ✅ **Descriptive Names** - Clear test case descriptions
4. ✅ **Test Fixtures** - Reusable test data factories
5. ✅ **Mock External Services** - No external API calls during tests
6. ✅ **Database Cleanup** - Proper cleanup between tests
7. ✅ **Coverage Thresholds** - Enforced 80%+ coverage
8. ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** - Detailed testing guides

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors**
```powershell
# Ensure database exists
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE telecom_billing_test;"
```

**Tests Hanging**
- Check database connections are closed
- Increase Jest timeout
- Verify async operations have await

**Port Already in Use**
```powershell
# Kill process using port
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

## Next Steps

### To Run Tests
```powershell
cd backend
npm test
```

### To Add More Tests
1. Create new test file in appropriate directory (unit/integration/e2e)
2. Import test helpers and fixtures
3. Follow existing test patterns
4. Run tests to verify

### To View Coverage
```powershell
npm run test:coverage
start coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Test Infrastructure** - Complete with helpers and fixtures
